Objective To explore the clinical and laboratory characteristics and the prognosis of disseminated non-tuberculous mycobacteria(NTM)diseases in human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)negative patients. Methods Cases of disseminated NTM disease were retrospectively collected in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2012 to October 2018.Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment, and prognosis of these cases were retrieved from the electronic medical record system. Results Among the 23 HIV negative patients with disseminated NTM disease,21 had underlying diseases, with rheumatoid immune disease(n=7)as the most common one. The main clinical manifestation was fever(n=23).Laboratory tests showed anemia [hemoglobin(85.78±25.47)g/L],hypoalbuminemia [albumin 29(27-32)g/L],elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [(85.73±43.78)mm/h] and hypersensitive C-reactive protein [(112.00±70.90)mg/L], and reduction of lymphocyte count [0.69(0.29-2.10)×10 9/L].Lymphocyte subset analysis indicated reduction in CD4 + T cells [213(113-775)/μl],CD8 + T cells [267(99-457)/μl],B cells [39(4-165)/μl],and NK cells [88(32-279)/μl] and elevation of human leukocyte antigen-D related(HLA-DR),and CD38 expression in CD8 + T cells [HLA-DR +CD8 +/CD8 +,60(40-68)%;CD38 +CD8 +/CD8 +,81(65-90)%].The most common species of NTM was Mycobacterium intracellular(n=6).Lymphocyte,CD8 + T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts were significantly lower in dead patients than surviving patients(P =0.045,P=0.045,P=0.032,and P=0.010,respectively). Conclusions Disseminated NTM disease in HIV negative patients is mainly manifested as fever, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated inflammatory indicators. It is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients. Patients with decreased lymphocytes,CD8 + T cells, B cells and NK cells tend to have a poor prognosis.
