OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tight junction association proteins and mucin in the human airway epithelial cells.METHODS: Human airway epithelial cells NCI-H292 were randomly treated by ultraviolet light-inactivated RSV (control group) or thawed RSV (RSV infection group). After 48 hours of treatment, the protein levels of occludin, E-cadherin, phosphorylated EGFR and EGFR in NCI-H292 cells were measured by Western blot. The distribution and expression levels of occludin and E-cadherin in NCI-H292 cells were examined by immunofluorescence technique. The expression levels of MUC5AC mRNA in NCI-H292 cells were assessed by RT-PCR.RESULTS: The protein levels of occludin and E-cadherin were significantly reduced in the RSV infection group compared with the control group (P<0.05). The protein levels of phosphorylated EGFR and EGFR increased significantly in the RSV infection group compared with the control group (P<0.05). The MUC5AC mRNA levels also increased significantly in the RSV infection group compared with the control group (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: RSV may down-regulate the tight junction association proteins and up-regulate the expression of MUC5AC in airway epithelial cells, which contributes to epithelial barrier dysfunction. EGFR phosphorylation may play an important role in regulation of airway barrier.
