Objective To measure the effect of duck viperin protein on the proliferation of duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV). Methods We analyzed the duck viperin gene using a bioinformatics. Plasmids pGEX-6P-viperin and pEGFP-N1-viperin were constructed and transformed into Rosseta and transfected into BHK-21 cells, respectively. BHK-21 cells transfected with plasmid pEGFP-N1-viperin and empty vector were infected with DTMUV. The content of DTMUV in cell precipitation and supernatant was analyzed by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR. Finally, the effect of viperin on DTMUV proliferation and the binding proteins captured by EGFP monoclonal antibody were evaluated using mass spectrometry. Results Significant differences were observed between the expression levels of viperin gene in duck compared to other species. Duck viperin was found to inhibit the budding of DTMUV in BHK-21 cells. Further, we identified six proteins that might be involved in the inhibition of the proliferation and budding of DTMUV, possibly indicative of the viperin anti-Tembusu virus pathway in ducks. Conclusion Expression patterns of duck viperin reveal how the budding of duck Tembusu virus is inhibited.
