Packaged adenovirus particles were used for infection of human periodontal ligament cells. The expression levels of hTERT and osteogenic genes, such as alkaline phosphatase, Runt-related transcription factor 2, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and collagen Ⅰ mRNA, were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The ability of osteogenic differentiation was observed by alizarin red staining, and the cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8.RESULTS: Adenovirus particles containing the hTERT gene were successfully constructed and infected with periodontal ligament cells. The infected cells were similar to normal periodontal ligament cells. The qRT-PCR results showed that hTERT and osteogenesis-associated genes were highly expressed in the periodontal ligament cell lines constructed by adenoviruses. Alizarin red staining showed that the periodontal ligament cell line had strong osteogenic differentiation capability. CCK-8 showed that the periodontal ligament cell line had strong proliferation capability.CONCLUSIONS: The human periodontal ligament cell line with high efficiency and stable expression of hTERT was established by the adenovirus method, thereby providing an ideal cell line for studying the mechanism of periodontal regeneration.
